## Social App made with RealmSDK.

Continuing my **Mongodb** journey I am experimenting on the client side now with
+ [RealmSDK](https://realm.io).

This is going to be a social app by the end of it. People will be able to  
login  
- [ ] Anonymously
- [ ] With Email
- [ ] With Google / Facebook

They will also be able to 
- [ ] Edit their account info
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Delete their accounts
- [ ] Add posts

### Bonus Features
Currently [ 17-3-2023 ] the app connects you to the sample_mflix collection and you can get info about the movies (genres, plot etc.).

Things that need a bit of polishing
- [ ] The UI.
