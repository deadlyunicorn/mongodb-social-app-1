## The Amazing Social App.

This project started for fun - as I was testing backend tools for the first time, 
was put on hold for 4 months and is finally finished with the version 3.

Main Tools used:
+ [NextJS](https://nextjs.org).
+ [MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com).
+ [AuthJS](https://authjs.dev).

Deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

This is a mock social app. 
People can login with OAuth or
Register and Login with credentials.

They can upload posts, comment, like, delete,
They can edit their profiles ( Avatar & Description ),
delete their profiles ( including all of their posts - comments etc.)
and <s>( #soon )</s> chat with other people!

Other tools used: Sendgrid, Bcrypt, TailwindCSS, Typescript, AWS S3, Framer Motion, Zod.
